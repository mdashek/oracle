For identifying the count of a specific character in a stirng, regexp_count can be user.

For example:
String: 'character'

If we want to identify the number of 'a' character in this string, then the query will be-

select regexp_count('character', 'a') from dual

Output: 2

For specifying from which position the count will start, we've to add another parameter in the function.

select regexp_count('character', 'a', 1) from dual

Output: 2

The above query asks for counting character from position 1.

For identifying substring count, same query can be used.

Substring: 'ab'
String: 'abcabcabcabc'

Query:
select regexp_count('abcabcabcabc', 'ab', 1) from dual

Output: 4
